# Algorithms in Java

This directory contains implementations of common algorithms in Java. The algorithms are organized into categories such as Sorting, Searching, and Dynamic Programming. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Java file for easy understanding and usage.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** is a simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**File**: [`BubbleSort.java`](Sorting/BubbleSort.java)
