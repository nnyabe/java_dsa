# Linked Lists in Java

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure in which elements (nodes) are stored in a non-contiguous manner. Each node contains two parts: data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists offer efficient insertions and deletions, particularly when the operations are performed at the beginning or middle of the list.

In this directory, you'll find different types of linked lists implemented in Java, each offering different characteristics and trade-offs depending on the use case. Linked lists are fundamental in many areas of computer science, including memory management, graph theory, and dynamic memory allocation.

## 1. Types of Linked Lists

There are primarily three types of linked lists:

- **Singly Linked List (SLL)**
- **Doubly Linked List (DLL)**
- **Circular Linked List (CLL)**

Each type has different properties and operations associated with it.

### 1. Singly Linked List (SLL)

A **Singly Linked List** is a type of linked list in which each node contains a data part and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to `null`, indicating the end of the list.

#### Key Features:
- **Directionality**: Nodes are only connected in one direction, from the head to the tail.
- **Operations**: Common operations on a singly linked list include insertion at the beginning, insertion at the end, deletion from the beginning, deletion from the end, and traversal (i.e., visiting each node in sequence).
- **Memory Efficiency**: Since each node only stores one reference (to the next node), singly linked lists use less memory than doubly linked lists. However, they are less flexible in terms of backward traversal or modification of previous nodes.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion at the Beginning**: Insert a new node at the head of the list. This operation is very efficient (O(1)) because you only need to update the head pointer to the new node.
- **Insertion at the End**: Insert a new node at the tail of the list. This requires traversing the entire list (O(n) time complexity).
- **Deletion at the Beginning**: Remove the first node from the list. The head pointer is updated to point to the second node (O(1) time complexity).
- **Deletion at the End**: Remove the last node. This requires traversing the entire list to find the second-to-last node (O(n) time complexity).
- **Traversal**: Visit each node of the list in sequence, typically starting from the head and following the next pointers until you reach a node whose next pointer is `null`.

### 2. Doubly Linked List (DLL)

A **Doubly Linked List** is a type of linked list in which each node contains three parts: the data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions—forward and backward.

#### Key Features:
- **Bidirectionality**: Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. This allows for efficient operations at both ends and easier backward traversal.
- **Operations**: Doubly linked lists are more versatile than singly linked lists due to the ability to traverse in both directions. However, they require more memory per node because of the additional reference (to the previous node).
- **Use Cases**: Doubly linked lists are particularly useful in applications where both forward and backward traversal is required, such as in browser history, undo/redo operations, and in implementing certain data structures like deques.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion at the Beginning**: Insert a new node at the head of the list. This operation involves updating the head pointer and setting the previous pointer of the next node to the new node (O(1) time complexity).
- **Insertion at the End**: Insert a new node at the tail. This operation is efficient (O(1)) because the list maintains a reference to the tail node.
- **Deletion at the Beginning**: Remove the first node and update the head pointer. The second node's previous pointer is also updated to `null` (O(1) time complexity).
- **Deletion at the End**: Remove the last node. The second-to-last node’s next pointer is set to `null`, and the tail pointer is updated (O(1) time complexity).
- **Traversal Forward**: Traverse the list from the head to the tail, visiting each node in sequence.
- **Traversal Backward**: Traverse the list from the tail to the head, visiting each node in reverse order.

### 3. Circular Linked List (CLL)

A **Circular Linked List** is a variation of a linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. Circular linked lists can be either singly or doubly linked.

#### Key Features:
- **Circular Nature**: The last node’s next pointer points to the first node, which means the list doesn’t have a clear end. This can be useful for applications that require a continuous loop or cycling through elements (e.g., round-robin scheduling).
- **Traversal**: In a singly circular linked list, you can traverse through the list in a continuous loop until a stopping condition is met. In a doubly circular linked list, you can traverse in both directions and form a complete cycle.
- **Operations**: Circular linked lists support the same operations as singly and doubly linked lists, with the added complexity of handling the circular nature (e.g., detecting the end of the list when traversing).

#### Operations:
- **Insertion at the Beginning**: Insert a node at the start. The new node’s next pointer is updated to point to the previous head, and the last node’s next pointer is updated to point to the new head (O(1) time complexity).
- **Insertion at the End**: Insert a node at the tail. The new node's next pointer points to the head node, and the previous tail's next pointer is updated to point to the new node (O(1) time complexity).
- **Deletion at the Beginning**: Remove the first node. The head pointer is updated, and the last node’s next pointer is updated to point to the new head (O(1) time complexity).
- **Deletion at the End**: Remove the last node. The second-to-last node’s next pointer is updated to point to the head (O(n) time complexity in a singly circular linked list, O(1) in a doubly circular linked list).
- **Traversal**: Traverse the list starting from the head and continue cycling through the nodes until the starting point is reached.

## 2. Advantages of Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a fixed size. They can grow or shrink as needed without reallocating or resizing memory.
- **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**: Inserting or deleting a node in a linked list (especially at the head) is more efficient than in an array, where shifting elements may be required.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Memory is allocated dynamically for each node, so memory is used more efficiently compared to arrays, which may allocate unused space.

---

## 3. Disadvantages of Linked Lists

- **Memory Overhead**: Each node in a linked list requires extra memory to store the pointer(s) in addition to the data. This overhead can be significant, especially for large data sets.
- **Random Access**: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not support efficient random access to elements. To access an element at a specific index, you must traverse the list from the head (O(n) time complexity).
- **Complexity in Implementation**: Linked lists require careful handling of pointers, especially when inserting or deleting nodes, and errors such as null pointer dereferencing can lead to bugs.

## 4. Use Cases for Linked Lists

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Linked lists are ideal for scenarios where the size of the data structure can change frequently, such as in memory management systems.
2. **Implementing Other Data Structures**: Many advanced data structures, such as queues, deques, and graph representations, can be implemented using linked lists.
3. **Real-time Systems**: Circular linked lists are useful in systems where data needs to be processed in a continuous loop, such as in round-robin scheduling.

## 6. Conclusion

Linked lists are powerful and versatile data structures that are well-suited to a variety of scenarios, especially when dynamic memory allocation, fast insertions, and deletions are needed. While they come with certain trade-offs like memory overhead and lack of random access, their advantages in certain contexts make them an essential part of the data structure toolkit.

This directory provides several linked list implementations to demonstrate their uses and operations. Each linked list type comes with specific characteristics that make it useful for different situations, so understanding how to leverage them effectively is key to solving real-world problems in software development.
